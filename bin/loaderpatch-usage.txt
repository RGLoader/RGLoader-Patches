commands:

.patch <name> <ver>
=sets the patch targets name and version, should be first thing in a script


.extend 0x<length>
=extends the target to the length specified. make sure length is in hex and starts with 0x


.set <variable> "<text>"
=sets variable value to specified text


.string <variable>
=outputs the variable to the end of the target file


.string "<text>"
=outputs the text to the end of the target file


.data 0x<offset>
<hex data>
.eod
= writes hex data to specified offset, make sure offset is in hex and starts with 0x


.code <options> 0x<offset>
<ppc assembly code>
.eoc
= compiles code and will do a few things depending on options:
b will write the code to the end of the target file, append a branch back to offset + 4 and set offset to a branch to this code
bl will write the code to end of the target file, append a blr to the end of it (don't include this in your code!) and set offset to a branch w/ link register to this code
no options will just write the code to specified offset, overwriting data
(i think i only implemented the b option, but others will be done in future)


.include "<filepath>"
= includes the specified file into the current patch
